# Kitty Cats

I created a website which generates a random image of a cat everytime a button is pressed, This was my first attempt making a website that uses an API to display images on a screen.
I also made it so that eveytime the button is click a random cat fact pops up.

I used a standard dark mode styling.

This project helped me to better understand how to use API in javascript along side HTML
